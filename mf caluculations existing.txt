Direct answer: Standard practice estimates the multifractal triple by (1) H via DFA/MF‑DFA slope of log S2(τ) vs log τ; (2) λ (intermittency) from curvature of the scaling function ζ(q) or width Δh of the multifractal spectrum; (3) α (central stable‑like tail) by fitting a Lévy‑stable or scaling law to the core; and (4) a separate far‑tail α via extreme‑value methods (Hill/POT) on exceedances.[1][2][3]

## H (Hurst exponent)
- Compute generalized structure functions Sq(τ)=E|X(t+τ)−X(t)|^q across lags; estimate H as the slope of log S2(τ) versus log τ (or use DFA/MF‑DFA for robustness to trends), typically over an intermediate scaling range to avoid microstructure and aggregation biases. [1][4]  
- MF‑DFA steps: integrate demeaned series, detrend in windows, compute fluctuation functions Fq(s) and fit Fq(s)∝s^{h(q)}; H is h(2) for returns.[4][5]

## λ (intermittency strength)
- Estimate the scaling function ζ(q)=qH−(λ^2/2)(q^2−q) for lognormal‑cascade–type models by regressing log Sq(τ) on log τ across multiple q; infer λ from the curvature (departure of ζ(q) from linearity).[3][5]
- Alternatively, compute the multifractal spectrum f(αloc) via Legendre transform of τ(q)=ζ(q) and summarize λ by spectrum width Δh=h(qmin)−h(qmax) as a practical intermittency proxy: larger Δh implies stronger multifractality.[5][1]

## Central “stable‑like” α (core tails)
- Fit the central body of returns with a Lévy‑stable model or symmetric power‑law windowed around the center (excluding extremes); report α from maximum likelihood or quantile‑based methods, acknowledging that pure stable fits generally hold only in the core, not in far tails.[6][5]
- Cross‑check with log–log survival plots over moderate thresholds to ensure a stable‑like slope before extreme cutoffs.[6]

## Far‑tail α (extremes)
- Use extreme‑value theory on exceedances: Hill estimator on the top‑k order statistics or Peaks‑Over‑Threshold (POT)/Generalized Pareto; select k/threshold via stability plots or cross‑validation, and report α (tail index) with CIs, separately for upper/lower tails.[2][1]
- Validate with QQ‑plots against a fitted Pareto/GPD; perform sensitivity analysis across plausible tail fractions to demonstrate robustness.[1][3]

## Practical pipeline
- Preprocess minimal cleaning; compute MF‑DFA Fq(s) for q grid (e.g., 0.5–4.0) and lags spanning days to months; estimate h(q), derive ζ(q), H=h(2), and λ from ζ(q) curvature or Δh.[4][5]
- Estimate central α via stable fit on middle quantiles (exclude top/bottom 1–5%); then estimate far‑tail α via Hill/POT on upper and lower tails separately (e.g., top 1–5%), with rolling windows for regime shifts.[2][1]

## Reporting norms
- Always state horizon, q‑range, scaling window, detrending order, and tail threshold/k; provide uncertainty (bootstrap CIs) and show stability plots for tail estimates; note crises widen ζ(q) curvature (↑λ) and may reduce far‑tail α (heavier tails).[3][1]
