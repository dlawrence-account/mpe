## Abstract

This paper introduces the Multifractal Asset Pricing Model (MAPM), a revolutionary framework that unifies three distinct mathematical traditions: Pareto-Lévy stable distribution theory (α parameter), fractional Brownian motion theory (H parameter), and multifractal theory (λ parameter). MAPM replaces traditional derivative pricing with a unified three-parameter system that treats every derivative as a claim on specific parts of a multifractal return distribution.

The stability index α follows Pareto-Lévy distribution constraints with empirical bounds 1.5 ≤ α ≤ 1.8 for financial time series. Through the Pareto-Lévy convolution theorem, α remains constant across all derivatives for a given underlying asset. However, the Hurst exponent H and intermittency coefficient λ may vary by derivative type based on their specific sampling of the underlying multifractal process.

Our analysis of NASDAQ 100 data from 1998-2025 shows α = 1.8 across all derivative classes, while H and λ exhibit predictable derivative-specific patterns. Following Zolotarev (1986), MAPM uses characteristic functions for density recovery since stable distributions generally lack closed-form PDFs or CDFs.

Market efficiency emerges through Kelly-criterion trading that transforms clustered red-noise input into scale-invariant pink-noise output. We establish twelve fundamental theorems providing rigorous mathematical foundations. MAPM represents the most significant advance since Black-Scholes by combining three mathematical frameworks into a unified derivative pricing theory.
